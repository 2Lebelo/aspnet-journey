## 📁 Projects

Individual projects are organized in the `projects/` directory. Each project has its own README with specific setup instructions and learning goals.

### How to Add a New Project

1. Create a new directory in the `projects/` folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir projects/project-name
   cd projects/project-name
   ```

2. Initialize your ASP.NET project:
   ```bash
   dotnet new webapi -n ProjectName  # For Web API
   dotnet new mvc -n ProjectName      # For MVC
   dotnet new webapp -n ProjectName   # For Razor Pages
   ```

3. Add a README.md in your project directory documenting:
   - Project description and goals
   - Technologies used
   - What you learned
   - How to run the project

## 🎯 Learning Goals
